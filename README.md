Usage
=====

Clone this repo into your home directory either as `.vim` (linux) or `vimfiles` (MS Windows).
Then cd into the repo and run `rake` to get default set of bundles.
If you intend to do some rails development then you might want to run `rake rails`

Check out _Rakefile_ for some other tasks.

Put this in your vimrc along with your personal hacks:
    source ~/.vim/vimrc      "linux
    source ~/vimfiles/vimrc  "windows
